Oh No Covid Layer 2 Solution


The goal of this project is to create an easy way to deploy raspberry pi remote dropboxes that allow for remote nessus scanning, saving time on setup and cost.


The Lab: 

1. Home router branched from my main router
2. Intel NUC with Kali Linux, VirtualBox, and Detection Lab (4 VMs)***
3. Raspberry Pi

***Detection Lab was modified to connect directly to the public network and use static IPs, this allowed them to be discoverable by external hosts.
